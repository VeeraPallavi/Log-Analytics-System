Hadoop Architecture Evolution

Hadoop 1.x Architecture

Overview: 
- Hadoop 1.X follows monolithic architecture.
- Resource management and job scheduling is handled by single master component.

Core Components:
	- HDFS (storage)
	- MapReduce (processing)

JobTracker: Centralized master node responsible for resource management and job scheduling.
TaskTracker: Worker nodes executing tasks assigned by JobTracker.

Limitations:
Single point of failure: If JobTracker failed, the entire cluster stopped.
Scalability issues: JobTracker struggled to manage thousands of nodes.
Rigid architecture: Coupled resource management and job scheduling, limiting flexibility.

Hadoop 2.x Architecture

Introduction to YARN : Separation of resource management from job scheduling via YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator).

Components:
- ResourceManager: Global authority managing cluster resources.
- NodeManager: Manages resources on individual nodes.
- ApplicationMaster: Manages execution of a single application.

Advantages:
Scalability: Can handle thousands of nodes more efficiently.
Flexibility: Supports multiple processing frameworks (MapReduce, Spark, Tez, etc.) instead of only MapReduce.
Improved fault tolerance: Decentralized management reduces risk of single-point failures.

Hadoop 3.x Architecture

Overview:
Hadoop 3.X builds upon YARN and focuses on performance optimization, scalability, and fault tolerance.

Key Improvements:
High Availability: Multiple NameNodes supported, eliminating single points of failure in HDFS.
Erasure Coding: More space-efficient fault tolerance compared to replication.
Scalability: Supports clusters with thousands of nodes and petabytes of data.
Containerization: Native support for Docker containers in YARN.
Resource Scheduling Enhancements: Better utilization of cluster resources.
